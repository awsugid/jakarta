# Contributing to the AWS User Group Jakarta Blog

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you want to share a technical tutorial, an event recap, or your experience with AWS, this blog is the place for it.

This website is built with **Astro** and uses **MDX** for content. This means you can write standard Markdown but also embed interactive React components directly in your posts.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Fork and Clone
First, fork the repository on GitHub [here](https://github.com/awsugid/jakarta.git) and clone it to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jakarta.git
cd jakarta
```

### 2. Create a Branch
Create a new branch for your article.

```bash
git checkout -b blog/my-awesome-article
```

### 3. Create Your Post
Create a new file in `src/content/blog/` with a `.mdx` extension. The filename will become the URL slug (e.g., `my-awesome-article.mdx` becomes `/blog/my-awesome-article`).

### 4. Add Frontmatter
Every post needs a "frontmatter" block at the top to define metadata.

```yaml
---
title: "My Awesome Article"
pubDate: 2025-11-21
description: "A short summary of what this article is about."
author: "Your Name"
tags: ["aws", "serverless", "tutorial"]
slug: "my-awesome-article"
---
```

### 5. Write Content
You can use standard Markdown syntax for headers, lists, links, and code blocks.

#### Code Blocks
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello AWS Community!")
```

#### Lists
- Point 1
- Point 2
  - Sub-point

### 6. Using MDX Components (Advanced)
One of the coolest features of this blog is MDX. You can import and use React components!

For example, here is a live interactive counter component embedded right here in this article:

<DemoCounter client:load />

To do this, simply import the component at the top of your file (after the frontmatter):

```mdx
import DemoCounter from '../../components/blog/DemoCounter';

<DemoCounter client:load />
```

### 7. Submit a Pull Request
Once you are happy with your post:
1. Commit your changes.
2. Push to your fork.
3. Open a Pull Request (PR) to the main repository.

Our team will review your submission, and once approved, it will be live on the site!

Happy writing! 🚀
