# Why Single Table Design?

DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. But to truly leverage its power, you often need to rethink data modeling...

- **SK**: Sort Key

## Conclusion

It's not for every use case, but when it clicks, it's powerful.
