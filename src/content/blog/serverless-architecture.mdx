# Building Scalable Serverless Architectures

Serverless computing has revolutionized how we build and run applications. In this post, we'll explore key patterns for building scalable and resilient serverless architectures on AWS.

## Why Serverless?
- **No Server Management**: Focus on code, not infrastructure.
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales with usage.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for what you use.

## Key Services
1.  **AWS Lambda**: Run code without provisioning servers.
2.  **Amazon API Gateway**: Create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs.
3.  **Amazon DynamoDB**: Key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.

Stay tuned for more deep dives into each of these services!
